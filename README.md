# Genomin
Genomin, large-scale genomic analysis in VB6 (DNA sequence analysis). It reads (uses buffers) and processes large FASTA files (over 8Gb), which contain DNA sequences. The screenshot shows the analysis of a 180MB file (representing the chromosome 5 from Homo Sapiens). Some knowledge of genetics might be necessary for the use of the program.


For very big files, goto: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/

here you will find the genomes of many species.

Files compatible with Genomin have the extension ".fna" or ".fa" or ".fasta" or ".fas"
