# Genomin
Genomin, large-scale genomic analysis in VB6 (DNA sequence analysis). It reads (uses buffers) and processes large FASTA files (over 8Gb), which contain DNA sequences. The screenshot shows the analysis of a 180MB file (representing the chromosome 5 from Homo Sapiens). Some knowledge of genetics might be necessary for the use of the program.
