# Genomin
Genomin is an implementation for large-scale genomic analysis. It is made in Visual Basic 6.0 (VB6). It uses the seek method to generate buffers from large FASTA files (over 8 Gb). The screenshot shows the analysis of a ~ 250 MB FASTA file (representing chromosome 1 from Homo Sapiens).


For very big FASTA files, goto:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome?term=human&cmd=DetailsSearch

or

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000001405.26/

Note: Files compatible with Genomin have the extension ".fna" or ".fa" or ".fasta" or ".fas".
